# Hsiii.gitgub.io
This repository contains my personal website and other projects.

## Access the Page
You can find the pages under https://hsiii.github.io/portfolio.
I plan to build my portfolio page here, now it's still a barren land.

### Homepage
I use https://hsiii.github.io/homepage as my browser default page, since it's just for personal use, the accessibility sucks.
There's a quick link menu on the left, and a search bar will expand upon hitting space key or hover.

### Accent Marker
Under https://hsiii.github.io/accent-marker you can find an under development project, it might stop working sometimes, but when it does work, it can help you turn plain Japanese text into accent-marked ones!
The output can also be edited on click and exported as images or .pdf files, even copied to render on HackMD with my snippet OrangeSagoCream/AccentMarker.

### JP-Correct
There's also a Japanese related under development project under https://hsiii.github.io/jp-correct, it will support note taking and AI grammar checking for your Japanese speaking practices in the future!

### Playground
https://hsiii.github.io/playground is where I experiment with fun CSS ideas, things are unpredictable here, watch out!
