# Hsiii.gitgub.io
This repository hosts my personal website <https://hsiii.github.io>. I plan to build my portfolio page here - now it's just getting started.

## Subpages
I designed and built <https://hsiii.github.io/homepage> as my universal default tab. Beyond allowing for endless customization, it serves as a portable, browser-agnostic dashboard — providing instant access to my bookmarks on any machine or browser. No more migration pain!

## Installation & Setup
1.	Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Hsiii/Hsiii.github.io.git

    ```
3.	Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm i
    ```
4.	Start the development server:

    ```

## Building for Production
