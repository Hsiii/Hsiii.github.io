# Hsiii.gitgub.io
This repository contains my personal website <https://hsiii.github.io>, I plan to build my portfolio page here.
Now it's still a barren land.

## Other Pages
There're also other pages in my other repos under <https://hsiii.github.io>:

### Homepage
<https://hsiii.github.io/homepage> is my browser default page.
Since I'm the only visitor, I believe the accessibility sucks.

### Playground
<https://hsiii.github.io/playground> is where I experiment with (likely copied) CSS ideas, things are unpredictable here, watch out!
